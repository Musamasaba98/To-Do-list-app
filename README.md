## TO-DO LIST PROJECT
--------
This is JS-CAPSTONE project that was aimed at testing my vanilla javascript skills. It was a good one since it gave me a fair duel with some serious javascript concepts like :-

* functions
* DOM
* arrays
* objects
* localStorage etc.

### STEPS I FOLLOWED
I always start by creating a Kanban board for my project which gives me a clear insight of the tasks ahead and helps gain an understanding of the chores, so that I focus on them first.

Secondly, I brain stormed and created a wireframe using Figma which was quiet easy to come up with and this greatly helped me to gain a clear view of what I wanted my users to interact with.

Thirdly, I now started putting writing my vision into code.
